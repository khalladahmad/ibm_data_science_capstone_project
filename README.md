IBM Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis


This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal of this project is to analyze historical launch data from SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets and develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a successful rocket landing.

Project Highlights:

* Collected and cleaned Falcon 9 launch data using SpaceX API and web scraping
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand launch trends
* Visualized data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium
* Built classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict launch success
* Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated model performance

Key Components:

* `Data Collection.ipynb`: Extracts launch data using SpaceX API and Wikipedia
* `Data Wrangling.ipynb`: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset
* `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
* `Machine_Learning_Prediction.ipynb`: Model building, training, and evaluation
* `Dashboard.ipynb`: Interactive dashboard built with Plotly Dash (optional)

 Skills Applied:

* Data wrangling and cleaning
* Data visualization
* Supervised machine learning
* Model evaluation and comparison
* API handling and web scraping

 Outcome:

The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, showcasing the capability to predict SpaceX Falcon 9 landing outcomes with meaningful insights.
